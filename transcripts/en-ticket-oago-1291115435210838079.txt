[03:12 PM] maybeizen: and yes people can link with the same email
[03:12 PM] oago: like it jsut says "ok you entered this email so it must be yours"
[03:13 PM] oago: couldnt someone say their email is X and it isnt and get their server deleted
[03:13 PM] maybeizen: people could do that on the last system as well
[03:13 PM] oago: i know
[03:13 PM] oago: so we're trying to prevent it
[03:14 PM] maybeizen: theres not really a way to confirm that the email is theirs
[03:14 PM] oago: send an email to them?
[03:14 PM] maybeizen: i mean the bot could send an email, not sure how that would work though
[03:14 PM] oago: send a code
