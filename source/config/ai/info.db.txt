If you tried to change the version via the "Versions" tab, then you may be doing it incorrectly, please follow the next steps:

Delete all the files/directories in the File Manager (Backing up any data you would like of course.)

Navigate to the startup tab, and make sure the variables are set as follows:

   Server Jarfile: server.jar   
   Minecraft Version: Ex: 1.12.2

After setting the variables, go to the "Settings" tab and select "Reinstall Server"

I. Your server isn't optimized
It is highly recommended that you optimize your Minecraft Server to use some resources and be more efficient while running. If you would like a tutorial to learn how to do this, you can read this guide  on GitHub.

Here are some quick tips for optimizing your server:

Use optimized software like Paper or Purpur.
Use fewer plugins.
Do world Pregeneration like with Chunky 
There is also a paid alternative to all of this like Coremaster  built by SrCodex. It is a group of plugins with highly optimized configurations to reduce the resources consumed by your server and increase its efficiency.

 
Of course, following the guide above will provide you will the best performance increases, without having to spend on something such as CoreMaster.

For this process, you might follow the next steps:

Go to your Panel  and select your server.
On your top left side, you will find the Users Tab.
On the Users Tab you need to click New User and add the e-mail he owns on Nether Host.
Once you add he's / her's e-mail, you might give them specific permissions.

I cannot connect to the panel!
If you are running into the issue where the panel does not load for you, or a warning message like this appears saying:

We're having some trouble connecting to your server

DO NOT PANIC 
This is a simple issue when one of our nodes goes down, or the server (that is hosting on the panel) fails to receive data from the other nodes. In this case, the best thing to do is wait. Ask in our Discord Server  and see if other users are having this problem.

If the other users are having this problem, try completing the following:

If you use a VPN try turn it off.
Change Browsers (Ex. if you are using Google Chrome, switch to Microsoft Edge).
Clear your browser/site cache on your browser settings.
Check your internet connection, you can see it on SpeedTest.net 
If all of these fail, it is quite likely our servers is experiencing issues.
